It shows metrics data for our application.
Ex: Free disk space, data related to executors pool, cpu usage, data related to jvm threads and memory etc.
These metrics data can be published to monitoring tools like prometheus/grafana and we can see beautiful graphs showing
cpu usage
or showing memory usages of our application.
